		<h2>Back in the day...</h2>
		<p>I was born and raised in New Jersey, just a few townships over from where Tony Soprano is from. My dream was to become a professional skateboarder or rapper <b>(I was equally bad at both)</b>. We shipped off for the west coast when I was in high school and I've been here ever since!</p>

		<h2>Things I like doing</h2>
		<p>I grew out of my pro skater and rapper dreams. Since then, I've focused my energy on more important things like video games and comics. When I'm not working on some killer code, I spend my day catching up on some uncanny x-men or wasting the day playing overwatch.</p>

		<h2>Things I wanna do before it's too late</h2>
		<p>Like everyone else in this world, I have a list of things I plan on getting done before I kick the proverbial bucket. Here's are a few of my favorite things...</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Publish my own comic book</li>
			<li>Surf in Bali</li>
			<li>Get a tattoo in every country I visit
			</li>
			<li>Back pack through Europe (just so I can be one of <i>those</i> people that tells everyone that they did it) </li>
		</ul>
